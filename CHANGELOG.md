#### Release information

This release updates the extension in order to make it compatible with showdown v.1.0.x.
However, this version is not compatible with older versions of showdown.
Since prettify extension was previously bundled with showdown, with versions prior to v 1.0.x, use the bundled version instead.

#### Breaking changes

* **renamed files**: src file renamed to `showdown-prettify.js`.
